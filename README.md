# voxel-drop

Drag and drop various types of files to load them into your game (voxel.js plugin)

Uses the [W3C File API](http://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/) to read file data dropped by the user from
their desktop to the browser. Currently recognizes (warning: experimental):

* .zip: loads textures using [artpacks](https://github.com/deathcap/artpacks)
* .js: loads JavaScript and/or plugins using [voxel-plugins](https://github.com/deathcap/voxel-plugins)
